            <br>
            It can be found on Croatia's Adriatic Sea coast, just lingering on the border between Zadar and the nation's capital, Zagreb.
            <br> <br>
            These lakes consist of 16 bodies of water that are all joined together by a variety of cascading waterfalls and fascinating bridges, flanked by age-old emerald forests that hold wildlife aplenty: birds, wolves, bears, and more!
            <br> <br>
            Enjoy walks in one of the top travel destinations in the country across a variety of paths, both natural and man-made, and explore the wide expanse between the lowest altitude lakes of 280 meters and the highest 1,000 meters above it.
            <br> <br>
            Some things you can go see at <em>Plitvice Lakes</em> are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>16 cascading lakes and more than 60 waterfalls.</li>
            <li>The water changing color constantly, from day to day.</li>
            <li>The bizarre cave creatures which differ wildly from other creatures you might know normally.</li>
        </ul>
        <br> <br> <br>
        <h class="h">Marble Caves</h> <br>

            <br>
            The <em>Marble Caves</em> are among the best places to visit if you are a fan of unreal sights that you can barely believe exist.
            <br> <br>
            These caves are found on the border of Chile and Argentina, on the General Carrera Lake, and they are formed through tunnels and caverns that hold some of the most important and beautiful marble depositions the world has to offer.
            <br> <br>
            You'll be able to see the marble reflected in the vivid water beneath, changing in appearance with the tide and as the seasons turn.
            <br> <br>
            Some of the places you can go to while at the <em>Marble Caves</em> would be:
        </p>    
        <ul>
            <li>The Pared Sur Eco-Camp, which has eco-domes near General Carrera Lake, giving views of it.</li>
            <li>The San Rafael Glacier, a beautiful wall of ice hidden right in the middle of the rainforest.</li>
            <li>The Carretera Austral, the road that runs south through southern Chile connecting to other roads by ferry or passes into Argentina. 
                The unpaved road passes through lush temperate rainforests, skirts fjords, is surrounded by snow capped peaks, hanging glaciers, open plains, meandering glacial river and lush green valleys.</li>
        </ul>
        <br> <br> <br>
        <h class="h">Darvaza gas crater</h> <br>
        <p id="p3">

            <br>
            The <em>Darvaza gas crater</em>, popularly also termed as the Door to Hell, is one of those cool places that you just can't miss.
            <br> <br>
            Located in the Karakum Desert, it is thusly named because it is a giant pool of crimson lava that gives off huge waves of steamy heat.
            <br> <br>
            Essentially, this crater was formed by the collapse of natural gas field into some caverns below, where it was then, remarkably, deliberately put on fire in order to keep its methane gas content from escaping to the outside.
