            The <em>Marble Caves</em> are among the best places to visit if you are a fan of unreal sights that you can barely believe exist.
            <br> <br>
            These caves are found on the border of Chile and Argentina, on the General Carrera Lake, and they are formed through tunnels and caverns that hold some of the most important and beautiful marble depositions the world has to offer.
            <br> <br>
            You’ll be able to see the marble reflected in the vivid water beneath, changing in appearance with the tide and as the seasons turn.

            The <em>Darvaza gas crater</em>, popularly also termed as the Door to Hell, is one of those cool places that you just can’t miss.
            <br> <br>
            Located in the Karakum Desert, it is thusly named because it is a giant pool of crimson lava that gives off huge waves of steamy heat.
            <br> <br>
            Essentially, this crater was formed by the collapse of natural gas field into some caverns below, where it was then, remarkably, deliberately put on fire in order to keep its methane gas content from escaping to the outside.
